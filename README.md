# Objective
A popular social engineering technique that imitates reliable webpages and unified resource locators (URLs) is called phishing websites. This project aims to train deep neural nets and machine learning models using a dataset designed to identify phishing websites. Website URLs, both benign and phishing, are collected to create a dataset, from which necessary URLs and content-based attributes are retrieved. Every model's performance level is measured and contrasted.
